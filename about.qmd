### When not doing research... 

- I enjoy playing basketball, soccer, and rock climbing,
- Spending time with my 9 chickens, dog, and 2 cats, and
- Hanging out with my partner and kiddo on the porch is best of all. 

I also really adore beans, and their beautiful seed coats bring me joy. I'm grateful to be working with a crop I love!
